      notes: |
        Implemented comprehensive workspace cost isolation with defense-in-depth:
        - 4 security layers (JWT, Guards, Interceptors, RLS)
        - Row-Level Security policies on api_usage table
        - 51 test cases (18 integration + 33 attack scenarios)
        - Complete security architecture documentation

        E2E tests require test environment configuration to run.
        All security code implemented and ready for review.
